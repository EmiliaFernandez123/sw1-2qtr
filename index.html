		<td>poodle</td>
		<td> as someone who has a poodle, i can guarantee they are extremely intelligent, agile, and alot of the time, loud. they don't shed and have curly hair which gives way to alot of different cuts and styles. poodles usually require acitivites, as with alot of dogs, so they're still great as a housepet that you can have some exercise with!
